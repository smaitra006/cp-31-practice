# TLE Eliminators CP-31 Solutions
Welcome to my solutions repository for the TLE Eliminators CP-31 competitive programming practice sheet! This repository contains my solutions and learning journey through one of the most comprehensive problem sets for competitive programming preparation.

# 📚 About CP-31
CP-31 is a curated list of 31 essential competitive programming problems designed by TLE Eliminators to cover fundamental algorithms and data structures concepts. These problems are carefully selected to build a strong foundation for competitive
programming contests like Codechef, Codeforces, AtCoder, and ICPC.

# 🎯 Goals
Master fundamental competitive programming concepts
Improve problem-solving skills and speed
Build a strong foundation for advanced topics
Document learning progress and insights

# 🛠️ Languages Used
- Primary: C++

# Template Used
```cpp
  #include <bits/stdc++.h>
  using namespace std;

  #define ll long long
  #define vi vector<int>
  #define vll vector<long long>
  #define pii pair<int, int>
  #define pb push_back
  #define mp make_pair
  #define F first
  #define S second
  #define all(x) (x).begin(), (x).end()

  int main() {
      ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
      cin.tie(NULL);

      // Solution code here

      return 0;
  }
